### Introductionâ€“
RMS Titanic was a British ship that sank on 15 April 1912. It was carrying 2224 passengers of which more than 1500 died in this tragedy. Here we explore a dataset of 891 people on the ship to understand what factors might have helped a person to survive - age, class and sex. The data was first cleaned in jupyter notebook since some variables were missing and I had to tidy the dataset as well according to my use. It is attached in this project folder as Titanicdatacleaning.html along with the python file.

### Design- 
After Cleaning the data, I built worksheets and dashboards and created some calculated fields, parameter. With the ease of tableau features I found it very interesting to customize dashboards to make it more user friendly and to produce more insightful result without less efforts using pre attentive attributes.
Overall, I found the dependence on gender, age and passenger class for survival much stronger. I built some worksheets together as a dashboard as I found them a better way to communicate using filters and actions. I have used bar charts in my design as I believe they are a good way to compare two variables against one another. The pie chart gives a good holistic picture in one look so I have chosen it in places where I found it more relevant. Geographic maps are powerful for represting the location specific details easily and analytical features of tableau provides trend line, reference lines to make it more interesting.
